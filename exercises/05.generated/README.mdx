# Generating Seed Data

Hard-coding data works great for small datasets. But as your application data
requirements grow you're going to find it hard to keep up. You can certainly use
production data to help you come up with your seed data, but there are privacy
concerns there etc.

## Faker.js

A better way is to use a library like [faker](https://fakerjs.dev/) to

> Generate massive amounts of fake (but realistic) data for testing and
> development.

Faker has a good guide to get you an introduction to how it works in
[the usage docs](https://fakerjs.dev/guide/usage.html#create-complex-objects).
But here's a quick snippet from that to give you an idea:

```tsx
import { faker } from '@faker-js/faker'

function createRandomUser() {
	return {
		_id: faker.datatype.uuid(),
		avatar: faker.image.avatar(),
		birthday: faker.date.birthdate(),
		email: faker.internet.email(),
		firstName: faker.person.firstName(),
		lastName: faker.person.lastName(),
		sex: faker.person.sexType(),
		subscriptionTier: faker.helpers.arrayElement(['free', 'basic', 'business']),
	}
}

const user = createRandomUser()
```

## Dynamic Data

Another thing we'll be doing in our workshop involves generating a random number
of records (like a random number of images or notes). You can use faker to help
with that as well:

```tsx
import { faker } from '@faker-js/faker'

const numberOfThings = faker.number.int({ min: 1, max: 10 })

// then you can use that number to generate an array of things:
const things = Array.from({ length: numberOfThings }, () => {
	// create your thing...
})
```

Tip: if the thing you're doing is async, you can wrap it in `Promise.all`:

```tsx
const things = await Promise.all(
	Array.from({ length: numberOfThings }, async () => {
		// create your async thing...
	}),
)
```

## Unique Data

Another thing you'll want to be careful of when generating data is you
want to avoid creating duplicate data for unique fields. For example, if `email`
is a unique field, you'll need to make sure you don't generate the same email
address twice. Faker's mechanism for doing this is deprecated in favor of
[`enforce-unique`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/enforce-unique):

```tsx
const uniqueEmailEnforcer = new UniqueEnforcer()

const email = uniqueEmailEnforcer.enforce(() => faker.internet.email())
```

This will keep track of the generated emails and call the function again if it
finds a duplicate.

## Schema Validation

Finally, one more thing you'll want to consider when generating fake data is
that the data you generate matches your schema requirements. The
seed script isn't necessarily the place to test your application's resilience to
bad data (you should have tests for that).

For example, let's say you have a limit of 50 characters for the title of a
Review. You'll want to make sure you don't generate a title that's too long. For
example:

```tsx
const reviewTitle = faker.lorem.words(10).slice(0, 50)
```

Balancing realistic with practical is definitely in force here.
